    <h1>Secondary Navigation</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Primary Navigation</h3>
    <p>This navigation system contains the most important links, buttons, that need to be displayed on every single page of the site</p>

    <h3>Secondary Navigation</h3>
    <p>Known also as breadcrumb navigation. It consists of a clickable list of pages, attributes that led to the current page.</p>
    <p>It can help users understand the extent of the site and also where they are currently</p>

    <h4>Benefits of using breadcrumbs</h4>
    <p>Gives users an idea of where they are in the website</p>
    <p>Allows users to jump backwards in their navigation of the site, rather than clicking back until you find what you are looking for</p>

    <h2>Simple example of breadcrumbs</h2>

    <p>So, it is difficult to understand where you are on a website that lacks breadcrumb navigation</p>
    <p>This is how you add it</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the li that has a parent of breadcrumb, display property, inline</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs are separated by a / or >. Ad a pseudo-element (.breadcrumb li+li::before) as the property and value as (  content: ">";)</li>
        <li>Target the a tags inside the .breadcrumb that will remove the underline</li>
        <li>Add a hover</li>

    </ol>

    <ul class="breadcrumb">
        <li>
            <a href="">Shopping</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="">Fashion</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="">Shoes</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="">Jordans</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
