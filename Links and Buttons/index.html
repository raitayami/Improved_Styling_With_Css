    <h1>Links and Buttons</h1>
    <p>Signifiers are indicators that offer clues about how to interact with new objects or situations</p>
    <p>Showing interactivity and clickability through signifiers is a fundamental aspect of user interface design</p>

    <h2>Browser Link Styles</h2>

    <p>By default , browsers include a user agent stylesheet, which is a set of default styles included with the browser for use on all web pages</p>
    <p>The purpose of this is so all HTML file is styled reasonably so that users can read it properly</p>
    
    <p>Links are different from regular text due to their blue color.</p>
    <p>Browsers style links. Active and visited. Clicked bu not yet followed is red, visited is purple.</p>

    <h2>Link Styling</h2>

    <p>Differentiate links from text. Using properties such as color, text-decoration, border and so on...</p>
    <p>Link styles should not be replicated in other page text. Link color should contrast text colors in the design.</p>
    <p>For example, if all links are underlines, other text should not be</p>
    <p>Anchor text, the text between a tags, should be descriptive for the importance of usability, accessibility and SEO. </p>

    <h2>Tooltips and Titles</h2>

    <p>Adding title attribute to links is a tooltip and provides additional context to explaining what the  link does</p>

    <p>Note that title is a HTML way os creating tooltips, but it is known to create accessibility issues</p>
    <p>Just remember that when creating tooltips, research ways to make them accessible</p>

    <h2>Hover States and Cursors</h2>

    <p>The pseudo-class hover can style elements when you hover above the elements</p>
    <p>You can also change the cursor to a value such a pointer, this will change the cursor to a pointer </p>
    
    <p>Note that users should not be made to move their cursors around the website to know if something is a link or not.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Link States</h2>

    <p>Links have 4 main states</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Normal</li>
        <li>Hover</li>
        <li>Active</li>
        <li>Visited</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each state have an associated CSS pseudo-class, :link, :hover, :Active, :visited</p>

    <p>There is an ordering for the link state pseudo-class rules.</p>
    <p>The order goes like this</p>
    <ol>
        <li>:link</li>
        <li>:visited</li>
        <li>:hover</li>
        <li>:active</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The ordering will ensure that the rules cascade properly and the user can receive the most applicable visual feedback about the state of the link</p>

    <h2>Skeuomorphism and Flat Design</h2>

    <p>The concept of UI elements that replicate or imitate real-life counterparts is known as skeuomorphism </p>
    <p>This concept helps users understand how to use elements without training as it models real-life objects</p>

    <p>Flat design however, encourages that computer interfaces don't need to model real-life interfaces</p>
    <p>Flat design uses simplicity</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Buttons: Skeuomorphic styling</h2>

    <p>Skeuomorphic buttons design aims to imitate the appearance and interactivity of a real-life button. </p>

    <button class="skeuomorphic">CLICK ME</button>

    <hr>
    <h2>Buttons: Flat Design</h2>

    <p>Elements appear flat on the screen. Designers rely on other styling and signifiers to indicate clickability</p>

    <p>As there are fewer obvious signifiers surrounding buttons in a flat design, they should be visually distinct from other page elements</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>Buttons: Hover States</h2>

    <p>Buttons should make use of hover states and the curser: pointer declaration</p>

    <h2>Affordances, Signifiers, Clickability</h2>

    <h3>Clickability</h3>

    <p>Mouse click. The most fundamental human-computer interaction</p>

    <h3>Affordances</h3>

    <p>Objects afford the ability of users to interact with them in various ways.</p>

    <p>For example, a bench afford a person the ability to sit, but if it is not screwed to the ground, it also afford the user to throw it, flip it and many more actions</p>

    <p>Potentials for interaction are collectively called the affordances of an object</p>

    <h3>Signifiers</h3>

    <p>Signifiers are aspects of an object that a designer uses to indicate potential and intended affordances of an object.</p>

    <p>For example, a teacup with no handle affords the ability to lift it and drink it</p>
    <p>But designers and potters add handles to signify that users can and shoulder lift up the object and take a sip.</p>
    <p>The handle is an example of a common user experience pattern</p>

    <h3>UX PATTERNS</h3>

    <p>UX Patterns establish reusable solutions to common problems</p>

    <h3>Practice Concepts</h3>

    <p>The title attribute provides additional context of advisory text for clickable elements but not directly visible to users</p>

    <p>Tooltips is a visual element which displays additional context or advisory context or advisory text for clickable element and appears at the cursor</p>
